         "Her Hands Remember is a first-person, narrative-driven puzzle game set inside a warm, nostalgic Bosnian grandmother’s home—an intimate space filled with memory, culture, and quiet stories. The game invites the player to explore a lived-in house where every object matters: from sewing a goblen pillow, to making traditional Bosnian coffee, to placing jars back onto old wooden shelves, to tending to small interactive rituals passed down through generations. Through these gentle tasks, the player gradually uncovers the life, love, and legacy of the grandmother, experiencing the beauty of everyday traditions that shaped the household. At its core, the project is a tribute to heritage and identity—capturing the textures of Sarajevo homes, the warmth of family histories, and the emotional power of touch, memory, and ritual. With each puzzle completed, the player reconstructs pieces of a story told not through dialogue, but through objects, routines, and the silence of a house that remembers. Her Hands Remember blends cozy gameplay with cultural preservation, offering a heartfelt interactive experience where personal memories become universal, and where the smallest domestic gestures tell the largest stories.",

         "In a crooked little tower at the edge of the forest, a tired wizard tried to brew “just one more” potion before bed. One wrong ingredient, one overconfident stir… and the entire lab exploded in a burst of wild, unstable magic. Shelves collapsed, candles toppled, spellbooks flew everywhere, and every potion in the room shattered into sparkling floating shards.\n\nNow the tower is a complete disaster, and the magic isn’t going to calm down on its own. You arrive just in time to help the poor wizard fix his mistake. By matching hats, spellbooks, potions and candles, you absorb the runaway magic, earn coins and stars, and slowly rebuild each room of his home—from the ruined lab to the cozy observatory.\n\nClear levels, complete goals, and unlock new parts of the tower as you help him repair furniture, restock ingredients, and tame the chaos he unleashed. It’s not just about cleaning up a mess—it’s about giving the wizard his home (and his confidence) back, one spell at a time.",

The overworld map was added to visualize progression, letting players see their journey as they unlock new levels and slowly repair the tower.\n\nThroughout development, I tuned difficulty, effects, and UI to keep the experience cozy and approachable: short levels, snappy animations, and a gentle feeling of “helping” rather than grinding.

         "Our favorite duck set out on a mission to find a job that truly suited him. After trying professions that were clearly not meant for a duck, he finally stumbled upon a mysterious poster advertising a detective position. His first assignment? Recover a cursed family album from an old, abandoned mansion. But once Ducky Holmes waddles inside, the mansion doesn’t feel abandoned at all…  This project became The Haunting of Ducky Holmes, a short atmospheric detective game created for the Begginer Game Development and Design Course at my college, where it proudly won 1st place. The game features hand-drawn animations, a charming and comedic art style, environmental storytelling, and simple puzzle-driven exploration. Everything, from the duck’s walk cycle to the spooky mansion rooms, was crafted in just two intense days of development. Despite the short timeframe, the game delivers personality, humor, mystery, and the signature “ducky charm” that made the jury fall in love with it.
